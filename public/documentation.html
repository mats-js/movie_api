                application will provide users with access to information about different
                movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
                personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>

                <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)</li>
                <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
                <li>Allow new users to register</li>

                <li>Allow existing users to deregister</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Optional Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow users to see which actors star in which movies
